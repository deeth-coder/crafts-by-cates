      "I didn't grow up crocheting or knitting—I came to fiber arts later, searching for something slower, more intentional, and deeply creative. What started as a way to unwind after long days turned into a full-blown love affair with yarn, texture, and the quiet magic of making something beautiful from scratch.",
      "Today, I craft garments, blankets, and home pieces that blend modern style with timeless comfort. Every stitch is a reminder to slow down, to create with care, and to build a wardrobe and home filled with pieces that truly matter.",
      "Whether I'm working on a chunky knit cardigan, a delicate crochet top, or a textured throw blanket, my focus is always the same: beautiful, functional, handmade pieces crafted to be loved for years to come."
